# MERVBot

Built by Catid, just adding it to Github for posterity. A few example bots are included.

Visual C++ 6.0 is required, it can probably be optimized to be built by a modern compiler but for now just wanted to bring everything as-is.

### Building Plugins

A `src` folder includes all dependencies needed to build projects on your own. An example can be found on `src/Tutorial`.
Current work can be found inside `src/primbot`.
