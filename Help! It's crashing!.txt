Try to recreate the crash.  Find out what's triggering it if you can.

You should use DrWatson to give me information about the crash.

Instructions for DrWatson:

1. Start:Run
2. Type "drwtsn32 -i", press enter
3. Start:Run
4. Type "drwtsn32", press enter
5. Set where the logs and dumps are stored on your harddrive.

Use MERVBot_debug.exe for best results, though some crashes will only
happen with regular MERVBot.exe

Now when it crashes, DrWatson will pop up and write some info
to the logs you specified.  You may now send these logs and dumps
to me which will greatly improve my chances of fixing the glitch.
