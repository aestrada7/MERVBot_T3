----=History=----

9/7/05 - Added support to plugins for players to send !help messages from other arenas.

8/2/05 - Fixed plugin-generated arena changes so that the arena name is updated in the 'botInfo'.

7/23/05 - Added support for mixed-mode C++ plugins (see botdll.cpp comments for more info).
          Changed String::split behaviour to clear string and return what it used to be when splitting identifier is not found.

7/22/05 - Added support for creation parameter string to plugins.

7/21/05 - Bot now neuts flags when it gets them, instead of dropping.
          Added MapLoaded B2D event.

3/25/05 - Fixed a bug in, of all places, the keystream generator for encryption!  Thanks to Cyan~Fire:)
          -- Release marker 46

10/24/04 - Added !restart, and a change to class String for MMaverick@17thparallel.com

10/2/04 - Fixed a VS.NET bug that was triggered by Cyan~Fire's changes.
          This was causing !listop to crash the bot, for example.
          -- Release marker 45

8/4/04 - Merged code from Cyan~Fire to allow MERVBot code to compile in Dev-C++

7/27/04 - Fixed a bug in !load, that would not send arena settings to loaded plugins.
            I assume this has been causing the antiwarp bug and friends.

7/17/04 - Worked a little on the antiwarp bug

7/5/04 - CypherJF wanted a new bot2dll event, EVENT_BannerChanged to notify of players changing banners.

          -- Release marker 43

6/4/04 - 50% Packetloss found and fixed problems in the weaponInfo structure, sent with position packets.
         He also noticed that the Player::flash variable wasn't being initialized.
         And that NoisySpectator wasn't being noisy enough.
         -- Release marker 42

5/23/04 - 50% Packetloss reported a possible problem with default chat channel settings.

4/6/04 - Fixed some operator security bugs indicated on the fourms by Maverick (17th)

3/28/04 - Changing arenas works in ASSS.
          Starts sending position packets a little later (after first sec.chk), to work better with ASSS object protocol.
          Fixed MaxConnectionTries
          Fixed ASSS compat. for some other potential changes in the server
          -- Release marker 41

          Added support for 00 0e clusters before connections are established.

3/16/04 - Added enhancements from Invader-Zim from Gundam Wing:
           Now supports up to 32 plugins at a time
           --> Plugins crashing will no longer crash the bot too, when in "Release mode"
          -- Release marker 40

2/1/04 - SMod: !listspawns !uptime

1/5/04 - Someone on the forum requested that operators.txt accept Limited-ops.

1/1/04 - 50%ploss: move EVENT_ArenaLeave event before sending packet to server,
                      meaning that the plugins can send chat messages in response.

12/19/03 - Added another improvement by 50%packetloss, to delay clearing the flag list
              on a victory until after the plugins have had a chance to see where the flags were.
           -- Release marker 39pr-2

12/16/03 - FiftyPacketloss found an invalid flag pointer being sent to the plugins.
           1stStrike donated some webspace: http://catid.ssihosting.com

12/10/03 - FiftyPacketloss found a bug in the new plugin2core EVENT_GrabBall.  Merry x-mas
           Website is down so this release will be delayed.

11/30/03 - Flag victory rewards are now only given to players outside safety zone.

10/25/03 - Did a better job with the 127.x.x.x

           Audited flag system

           Added EVENT_GrabBall Bot->DLL
           Added EVENT_FireBall Bot->DLL
           -- Release marker 39pre

10/18/03 - Reversed thors with shrapnel to bullets, cuz it broke some plugins.
           Connects to 127.0.0.x, so you can host up to 768 bots local to the server from one EXE.
           Updated the README.

9/9/03 - Fixed bug on Flag Victory and Flag Reset: Player flag counts were not reset to 0

8/21/03 - Applied a patch by OmegaFirebolt for !listchat and !clearchat
          Fixed a bug where the bot would get caught in a loop with the server during high c2s packet loss
              Being at U and hosting a bot for some people helped to discover this

8/20/03 - Second semester of college starts in a week
          Applied a patch by OmegaFirebolt to have !read also re-read the Operators.txt file
          Compiling the core in debug mode now removes the exception catching blocks around the command interpreter (DLL's also)
             If you're having trouble finding where a DLL !command is crashing, i recommend turning on debug mode in both
             the plugin and the core.  When the exception is generated, your debugger will jump right to the offending statement.
          Bot now shoots thors with shrapnel when it's a sysop, etc.
          Renamed !lag command to !botlag (original command name was too generic)

7/27/03 - Small fix: when players die, number of transferred flags are now from packet data, not player data.
          Small fix: s2c 00 0b "cancel download" packet now properly handled.
          Fixed a crash bug: unchecked return value of 'new' operator during map decompression could lead to application death.
          Fixed poisoned map file vulnerability: now using zlib version 1.1.4
          -- Release marker 38

         Fixed player bounties not being increased after kills. Thanks to DeadlySoldier!!.

3/1/03 - Fixed *watchdamage support for direct-action shrapnel.
         Added new INI option: [MISC]NoisySpectator=1 will allow plugins to see item counts, but sends more packets.

2/23/03 - Added *watchdamage to bot core and plugins.
          -- Release marker 36

         Changed commtypes.cpp so Visual Studio 6.0 can compile it.
          -- Release marker 29
