How to upgrade the MERVBot core:

Download MERVBot.zip from my website.
Close the copies of MERVBot you wish to upgrade.
Extract MERVBot.EXE into each of your MERVBot folders.
Extract zlib.dll into each of your MERVBot folders.    [NEW!!]
You can delete the SUBSPACE.BIN file.  [NEW!!]
Done!  No need to redo everything.


Rule about downloading plugins:

Whenever you download a new plugin, make sure you have the latest version of the MERVBot core.
The plugins give little indication that they are out of date.
If you don't see any Ext: commands, upgrade your bot.

If a new version of a plugin you are using is available, you should download it.
New versions normally contain security patches and create a more reliable bot.
